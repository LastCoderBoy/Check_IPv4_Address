We can use the Pattern class in Java to check if a given string represents a valid IP address. 
You can define a regular expression pattern that matches valid IP addresses and use it with the Pattern class to perform the check.
In this example, MyRegex is a class that has one pattern final field and it stores the exact IPv4 pattern. The IPv4 pattern is defined using a regular expression. 
The regular expression ^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[0-1]?[0-9]?[0-9])\\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[0-1]?[0-9]?[0-9])$ checks for a valid IPv4 address.

Note that this example specifically checks for IPv4 addresses. If you need to validate IPv6 addresses as well, you would need a different regular expression and logic for handling IPv6 patterns.
